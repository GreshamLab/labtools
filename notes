use devtools::build() to create a package bundle with the vignettes included.
RStudio’s “Build & reload” does not build vignettes to save time.
Similarly, devtools::install_github() (and friends) will not build vignettes by default because they’re time consuming and may require additional packages.
You can force building with devtools::install_github(build_vignettes = TRUE). This will also install all suggested packages.

My hack:

1. use devtools::build() to create a package bundle with the vignettes include
2. unzip the tar
3. Move inst/doc folder to working directory

Seems like this may not be necessary, b/c if you install using:

install_github("GreshamLab/labtools", build_vignettes = TRUE)

Then the installed version comes with the vignette
